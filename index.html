                                <h3>One extra note in the upper range</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The structure is designed inspiring by a Spanish artist, 
                                    Mo. Manuel Barreiro (Paparolo).  
                                    A single-chamber and a doble-hole for the right pinky. 
                                    It enables rythmic playing with chromatic and also diatonic scales, 
                                    for Muiñeira, Xota, Reel and Jig.  
                                    It has 13 notes with 11 holes.  
                                    The range is one note wider in the higher register 
                                    without adding extra holes.  
                                    It allows to perform more Irish pieces 
                                    that previosly requierd a double-chamber.  
                                    Of couse, it is ideal for playing Alalá and Air as well.  
                                    Not only that, 
                                    a variety of the models of 12 notes with 11 holes are also available. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    They are durable and maintenable due to firing in higher temperture.  
                                    The colors and textures are entirely created through glazing and firing, 
                                    with no paints or coating applied.  
                                    It can be treated just like tableware.

                                    Born and raised in Japan. 
                                    Encountered Galician music in 2006,
                                    and took a trip to Galicia for the first time in 2010.
                                    In 2014, met Paparolo, who made the ocarina Carlos Núñez plays. 
                                    This meeting maked the begging of my exploration of the structure and interpretation of the ocarina, 
                                    with his guidance and support. 
                                    Around the same time, 
                                    investigated the history, culture and music of Galicia during graduate studies.

                                    Since 2024, has been progucing ocarinas, with
                                    demonstration performances are accompanied 
                                    by self-managed filming and recording.
