                        <h3>Shun Yonemura</h3>
                        <p>
                            Born in Kanagawa in 1989 and grew up in Tokyo.
                            I learned the violin in childhood, 
                            the harmonica and the tin whitsle in early teens.
                            I knew about the ocarina at that time, 
                            but it did not particularly inerest me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 2006, I saw an animation film of <i>Tales from Earthsea</i> 
                            directed by Goro Miyazaki in the theatre, 
                            and encontred the music composed by Tamiya Terashima 
                            and interpreted by Carlos Núñez.
                            I could not believe that its sweet sounds came from ocarina 
                            until I saw the documentary movie of the recording for the film.
                            It was entirely different from any other ocarina that I had heard in Japan. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 2010, I had traveled Galicia for the first time 
                            to find the ocarina which Carlos Núñez played. 
                            Finally in 2014 met Manuel Barreiro (Paparolo), who made it, in Santiago de Compostela.
                            In 2016, I started to live in Lugo for studing in graduate shcool.
                            Paparolo taught me about many things of the ocarina, the music and the culture of Galicia,
                            and also many musician and people there were great teachers as well for me.

                        <p>
                            I returened to Tokyo in the end of 2019, 
                            and started the pottery making in 2020.
                            I worked at a manufacturer of western concert flute from 2021 to 2023, 
                            then started to produce my own ocarina in 2024.

                        <h2>TO ALL WIND PLAYERS</h2>
                        <p>
                            I don't just play the ocarina—I also have experience with a variety of wind instruments, 
                            including the gaita galega, requinta, recorder, harmonica, tin whistle, low whistle, Irlish flute, and more.
                            I have great admiration for the musicianship and technical mastery of those who play these instruments. 
                            I genuinely believe that artists with such skills can bring fresh inspiration and innovation to ocarina perfprmance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My goal is to craft ocarinas that are far more than toys or something you'd find in a video game, 
                            they are serious musical instruments, designed to meet the standards of even the most discerning players. 
                            It would be a true honor for these musicians to try them and discover their potential.
