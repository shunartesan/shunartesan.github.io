                        <p>
                            Born in Kanagawa in 1989 and grew up in Tokyo.
                            I lerned the violin in childhood, 
                            the harmonica and the tin whitsle in early teens.
                            I knew about the ocarina at that time, 
                            but it did not particularly inerest me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 2006, I saw an animation film of <i>Tales from Earthsea</i> 
                            directed by Goro Miyazaki in the theatre, 
                            and encontred the music composed by Tamiya Terashima 
                            and interpreted by Carlos Núñez.
                            I could not believe that its sweet sounds came from ocarina 
                            until I saw the documentary movie of the recording for the film.
                            It was entirely different from any other ocarina that I had heard in Japan.

                            In 2010, I had traveled Galicia for the first time 
                            to find the ocarina which Carlos Núñez played. 
                            Finally in 2014 met Manuel Barreiro (Paparolo), who made it, in Santiago de Compostela.
                            In 2016, I started to live in Lugo for studing in graduate shcool.
                            Paparolo taught me about many things of the ocarina, the music and the culture of Galicia,
                            and also many musician and people there were great teachers as well for me.

                            I returened to Tokyo in the end of 2019, 
                            and sterted the pottery making in 2020.
                            I worked at a manufacturer of western concert flute from 2021 to 2023, 
                            then sterted to produce my own ocarina in 2024.

                        <h2>DEAR EVERY WHITSLER</h2>
                        <p>
                            Not only ocarina, I have experience playing the various wind instruments, 
                            such as gaita galega, requinta, recorder, hermonica, tin whistle, low whistle, Irlish flute, and so on.
                            I really admire the musicianship and technical skill of players of these instruments, 
                            and turly believe that musicians with such skills would innovate the performance of the ocarina.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The aim is to create high-quality ocarina that are far from toys or something you'd find in a video game, 
                            but rather instruments that can satisfy even the most discerning players. 
                            It would be an honor for these musicians to give it a try.
